Perfect Ostrove Blossom
=======================

A parody of Touhou: *Perfect Cherry Blossom*.

Run by opening `POB/index.html` in your browser.

Developed when bored in a high school computer science class (with teacher named
Ostrove), to search through the space of possible danmaku patterns, and meme at
the same time.

Uses a local copy of MathJax to display math because the development environment
at the school as nonexistent and everything had to be on a flash drive.

All credit for the POB music goes to ZUN.
