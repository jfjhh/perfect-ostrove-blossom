=======================

A parody of Touhou: *Perfect Cherry Blossom*.

Run by opening `index.html` in your browser.

Developed when bored in a high school computer science class (with teacher named
Ostrove), to search through the space of possible danmaku patterns, and meme at
the same time.

All credit for the POB music goes to ZUN.
